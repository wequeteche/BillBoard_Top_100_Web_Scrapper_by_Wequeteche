# BillBoard_Top_100_Web_Scrapper_by_Wequeteche
It's a web scrapper that scrapes BillBoard top 100 charts for the top 100 songs depending on the date you provide to the prompt.
It can print to the terminal lists of top songs and their artists, depending on your choice once prompted,
it creates an excel file from the finding, listing top songs and their artists from song no. 1 to 100.
You can opt out of the program by simply passing "OFF" to the prompt asking for the search date.
